# Brainfuck-Interpreter-in-Ti-Basic
A brainfuck interpreter written in TI Basic. It takes like 30 seconds to complete the "Hello World!" program, but it works. It is pretty simple to use. Open TI Connect CE to send over the program and run it on your calculator. It has only been tested on a TI 84 Plus CE, but it may work on other calculators with support for TI Basic (for older calculators, the data array may need to be made smaller). When you run the interpreter, you can input a brainfuck program and hitting enter will run it.

Note: There is a string buffer for input, so you don't have to type one character per line. When the brainfuck program asks for input, you can input more than one character and these will be used instead when future inputs are required, until this buffer has been emptied.
